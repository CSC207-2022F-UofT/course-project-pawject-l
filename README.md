## Pawject L

This is a repository for a group project for CSC207 at UofT. 

Pawject L is a pet matching app that allows pet owners to find compatible pets for meetups. Users can
create profiles with both their pets’ information and their own information, and log in and log out
as needed. They will be able to view and edit their profiles, as well as other users’ profiles.
Users are given pet matches based on inputted preferences (e.g. location, availability, species,
owner immunization status). They can swipe on matches, and if both users match with each
other, they can chat using text to set up a meetup. Once the user is given a match, the user will
not see the match again no matter the match status (if they swiped or not). Users can report
other users, and once a threshold is reached, the reported user will be dealt with appropriately.
